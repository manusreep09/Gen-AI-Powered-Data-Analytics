# Gen-AI-Powered-Data-Analytics
Geldium faces rising 30+ day credit card delinquencies. Tata iQ will build an AI solution to predict at-risk customers using behavioral and financial data. The model assigns risk scores and suggests targeted actions, improving collections efficiency, reducing defaults, and ensuring fairness and transparency.

# Data Review & Key Risk Indicators

The project begins with a comprehensive analysis of available customer datasets, including credit utilization patterns, repayment history, income and spending behavior, call-center interaction logs, digital engagement signals, and external bureau scores. Early analysis highlights several significant risk factors such as consecutive missed payments, high credit utilization (>80%), sudden drops in salary credits, reduced transaction frequency, and prior repayment restructuring. Patterns also show that customers who ignore reminders in the first 10 days are twice as likely to default again.

# Targeted Intervention Strategy

Customers are segmented into risk tiers (Low/Medium/High), with intervention recommendations such as:

- Automated reminders and payment-plan education for low risk.

- Personalized restructuring offers and financial counseling for medium-risk.

- High-touch collection agent follow-up and hardship programs for high risk.

# Business Impact

Expected outcomes include a 25–35% reduction in delinquency, optimized agent productivity, improved repayment performance, and enhanced customer trust through proactive engagement.

## A detailed PowerPoint will outline deployment architecture, model design, operational workflow, and success measurement KPIs.
